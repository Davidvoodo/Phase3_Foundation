Automation - Package Management, Version Control & CI/CD

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline implementation using GitHub Actions with the following features:

- **Build Stage**: Multi-environment Docker builds with Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- **Test Stage**: Matrix builds running unit tests and pylint code quality checks
- **Deploy Stage**: Helm chart validation and packaging with deployment simulation

## CI/CD Pipeline Features

### ðŸ”¨ Build Stage
- Matrix builds across multiple Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- Docker image building for each environment
- Dependency caching for faster builds

### ðŸ§ª Test Stage
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive pytest suite validation
- **Code Quality**: Pylint checks with score threshold of 8.0
- **Matrix Testing**: All tests run across multiple Python environments

### ðŸš€ Deploy Stage
- Helm chart validation and linting
- Chart packaging to artifacts
- Deployment simulation (safe for demonstration)
- Only triggers on main branch pushes
